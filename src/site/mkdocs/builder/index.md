# 🦜🕸️ LangGraph4j Builder { .no-toc }

Provides a powerful canvas for designing Agentic Workflow as LangGraph4j applications. 
> If you have interest in the implementation and/or contribution go to project [langgraph4j-builder] 👀

### WebUI

Based on project [langgraph-builder] we have integrate the **Langgraph4j** part (take a look to the [fork][langgraph-builder-fork]) so we can now **visually scaffolding a langchain4j graph** and **generate java code**

![builder](../images/langgraph4j-builder.mov.gif)

### Scaffolding

This module generate a langgraph4j scaffold from a [Domain Specific Language (DSL)][DSL] based on [YAML] format.

**DSL Example**

```yaml
name: CustomAgent
nodes:
  - name: model
  - name: tool
edges:
  - from: __start__
    to: model
  - from: tool
    to: model
  - from: model
    condition: route after reasoning
    paths: [tool, __end__]
```

### Setup (with Docker)

**Pull image**

```bash
docker pull bsorrentino/langgraph4j-builder:1.6-SNAPSHOT
```

**Run container**

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --name langgraph4j-builder-app \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v .:/app/workspace \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e LANGRAPH4J_GEN=generator-1.6-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
  -e RUNNING_IN_DOCKER=true \
  bsorrentino/langgraph4j-builder:1.6-SNAPSHOT
```
