# Langgraph4j generator

‼️ **PROJECT HAS BEEN RELOCATED TO [langgraph4j/langgraph4j-builder](https://github.com/langgraph4j/langgraph4j-builder)** ‼️
----

This module generate a langgraph4j scaffold from a [Domain Specific Language (DSL)][DSL] based on [YAML] format.

**DSL Example**
```yaml
name: CustomAgent
nodes:
  - name: model
  - name: tool
edges:
  - from: __start__
    to: model
  - from: tool
    to: model
  - from: model
    condition: route after reasoning
    paths: [tool, __end__]
```

## The Builder (WebUI)

Based on project [langgraph-builder] we have integrate the **Langgraph4j** part (take a look to the [fork][langgraph-builder-fork]) so we can now **visually scaffolding a langchain4j graph** and **generate java code**
