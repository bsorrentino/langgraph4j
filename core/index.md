# Tutorial: langgraph4j

**LangGraph4j** provides a way to build *stateful processes* that flow from one node to another
in a **graph-like** structure. It allows embedding subgraphs, managing data checkpoints, and 
resuming execution without losing progress. Each node/edge can run *actions* to transform or 
route data, while *channels* define how information is combined or appended along the journey. 
By compiling your graph, you get a verified, ready-to-run workflow that can pause or continue
reliably anymore.
